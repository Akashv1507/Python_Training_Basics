1. Inheritance
2. polymorphism
   2.a method(function) overloading
   2.b method overiding
3. Encapsulation- It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit and prevent direct access of variable(if you want external access to variables, you must do it thorugh methods) and also can be changed only via methods.
4. Abstraction

# implementation
